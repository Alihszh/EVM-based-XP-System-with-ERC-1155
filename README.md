# NFT-Based XP System
### Introduction
This project is an implementation of the XP Token System, a set of smart contracts that allow for the creation, transfer, and management of XP tokens and their conversion to NFTs. The contracts are written in Solidity and use the Ethereum blockchain for their deployment and execution.

### Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites
To get started, you will need the following:
- An Ethereum client, such as Geth or Parity, to interact with the contracts on the Ethereum network.
- A development environment for writing and deploying the contracts. This project was developed using the Truffle development framework.
- A web3 interface, such as MetaMask, to interact with the contracts through a web interface.

### Installing
To install the dependencies and set up the development environment, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the dependencies by running npm install in the root directory of the repository.
- Set up the development environment by running truffle develop in the root directory of the repository.
- Compile and deploy the contracts to your development network by running truffle migrate.

### Deployment
The contracts can be deployed to any Ethereum network, including the main network, test networks, and private networks. To deploy the contracts, follow these steps:
- Compile the contracts by running truffle compile.
- Migrate the contracts to the desired network by running truffle migrate --network <network name>.

### Built With
- Solidity - The programming language for writing the smart contracts
- Truffle - The development framework for writing, testing, and deploying the contracts
- Ethereum - The decentralized platform for deploying and executing the contracts
